In this project, we designed a low-cost mini-UAV laser scanning system with cost effective sensors including laser scanner, GNSS receiver, Camera etc. It has promising performance in capturing point clouds with good qualities in terms of centimeterlevel positional errors. Below is a demo videos of our system.<br/><br/>

Now, Kylin Cloud System has been applied to forest management. Experiments were undertaken in a forest park in Wuhan and results showed that the registration error of the multispectral Digital Orthophoto Map (DOM) and laser scanning data is about one pixel, demonstrating a high potential of the proposed low-cost
system. For more details, please refer to this [paper](https://yueyuanwen.github.io/files/UAV_GSW2019.pdf).<br/><br/>
