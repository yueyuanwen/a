With the increasing popularity of mobile social networking, user-generated content (UGC) has become an important way for users to express themselves and expand their location-based social networks (LBSN). Traditional LBSN is based on flat social media (e.g. text, picture, video), which can no longer meet people's increasing diversified needs. Augmented reality (AR) supplements the real-world views or scenes with virtual, computer-generated objects that appear to visually coexist in the same space. In this project, we developed a smartphone system integrating location-based AR and User Generated Content (UGC) with a novel human-computer interaction mode. Users can publish AR content in a 3D model associated with real-world coordinates, and interact with content published by others.<br/><br/>
We have developed two generations of products and won many top awards, including
* **First Prize & Most Valuable Investment Prize** *<span style="color:red">(TOP 1%)</span>*, 16th SuperMap Cup GIS Contest
* **Best Innovation Award** *<span style="color:red">(TPO 10 out of 4127 teams)</span>*, 7th China Software Cup-Software Design Competition for College Students
* **Honorable Mention**, 10th China (Shenzhen) Innovation Entrepreneurship Competition
* **Honorable Mention**, 2th Huace Cup Geodesy and GIS Innovation Contest
* **Honorable Mention**, Esri GIS Contest<br/><br/> 

Besides, one paper is under review.<br/><br/>
Now, we are looking for investment! Below are two demo videos of our product. If you are interested in our project, please don't hesitate to contact me!<br/>
