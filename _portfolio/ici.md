* A software based on Augmented Reality (AR) technology to show information on virtual models at specific locations. <br/>
In this project, we developed a smartphone system integrating location-based AR and User Generated Content (UGC) with a novel human-computer interaction mode. Users can publish AR content in a 3D model associated with real-world coordinates, and interact with content published by others.<br/>
We have developed two generations of products and won more than ten awards. Now, we are looking for investment! Below are two demo videos of our product. If you are interested in our project, please don't hesitate to contact me!
