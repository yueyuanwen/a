Augmented reality (AR) supplements the real-world views or scenes with virtual, computer-generated objects that appear to visually coexist in the same space. With the increasing popularity of mobile social networking, user-generated content (UGC) has become an important way for users to express themselves and expand their location-based social networks (LBSN). Traditional LBSN is based on flat social media (e.g. text, picture, video), which can no longer meet people's increasing diversified needs. In this project, we developed a smartphone system integrating location-based AR and User Generated Content (UGC) with a novel human-computer interaction mode. Users can publish AR content in a 3D model associated with real-world coordinates, and interact with content published by others.<br/>
We have developed two generations of products and won more than ten awards. Now, we are looking for investment! Below are two demo videos of our product. If you are interested in our project, please don't hesitate to contact me!<br/>
