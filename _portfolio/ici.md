With the increasing popularity of mobile social networking, user-generated content (UGC) has become an important way for users to express themselves and expand their location-based social networks (LBSN). Traditional LBSN is based on 2D social media (e.g. text, picture, video), which can no longer meet people's increasing diversified needs. Augmented reality (AR) supplements the real-world views or scenes with virtual, computer-generated objects that appear to visually coexist in the same space. In this project, we developed a smartphone system integrating location-based AR and User Generated Content (UGC) with a novel human-computer interaction mode. Users can publish AR content in a 3D model associated with real-world coordinates, and interact with content published by others.<br/><br/>
We have developed two generations of systems and won many top awards, including
* **First Prize & Best Valuable Investment Prize** *<span style="color:red">(TOP 1%)</span>*, 16th SuperMap Cup GIS Contest
* **Best Innovation Award** *<span style="color:red">(TPO 10 out of 4127 teams)</span>*, 7th China Software Cup-Software Design Competition for College Students
Besides, one paper about the first system was accepted by the Journal of Geomatics. Another paper about the second system was accepted at the ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on LocalRec 2019.

Now, we are looking for investment and cooperation. Below are two demo videos of our system. If you are interested in our project, please don't hesitate to contact us!<br/>
