## Abstract
Location-based social networks (LBSNs) enable individuals to connect tighter through users’ interdependency (e.g. friendship, common interests and shared knowledge) which derived from their physical locations and geo-tagged social media content. Nowadays, the development of mobile augmented reality (MAR) technology can enhance people’s perception and interaction with the world, which enrich the way people share their geo-referenced information. In this paper, we propose a LBSN-based smartphone system integrating MAR and user generated content (UGC). Users can publish their own content through an augmented reality (AR) form on a 3D model which is associated with real-world coordinates, and interact with content published by others. A prototype system is implemented on the iOS platform to prove the efficiency of the framework.
